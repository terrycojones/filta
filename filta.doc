(This is almost 200 lines long, but I thought it was worth typing in,
because I think it's worth reading. Do what you will.)

And now, for your continued uw.unix entertainment, here is a filter 
and filter builder.

For those who don't know what a filter is, here's a quick introduction.
If you do, skip on a bit. Probably the simplest definition is some
program that reads standard input and writes its results on standard
output. Hence all filters can be put in a UNIX pipeline. For instance

    cat file | eqn | troff | lpr -Pic -Ft
 
Here "eqn" and "troff" are filters.  Perhaps the best known filter is
awk, which uses its own little language to determine what the filter is
to do. For instance

    cat file | awk '{print $1}'

Will write the first (white space separated) field of "file" to
standard output (the screen in this case). The great advantage of awk
is that you can build your own filter to do literally anything. As many
have said (including the late and great Steve Hayman) "Awk is the king
of programming languages."

The only real problem with awk is that it is slow. It interprets your
small awk program. So when you are dealing with large files things can
grind to a standstill. Moreover if you want to do the same thing to
several files, the same procedure needs to be gone through with awk for
each one.

Suppose I wanted to do the above example on 3 files. Unless I wanted to
do some serious thinking I'd probably just say

    cat file1 | awk '{print $1}' > file1.out
    cat file2 | awk '{print $1}' > file2.out
    cat file3 | awk '{print $1}' > file3.out

It seems a waste that awk should go to all that trouble to parse your
program and build the filter and then throw it out - especially when
you want it again for the very next command.

What I have often wanted was some semi-automated way to produce filters
written in C. That way, with another (similar) little language, one
could produce a filter, compile it and run it repeatedly. Not only
that, adding to the produced filter would be possible, since you would
have the C code. Plus it would run quickly. I have written enough small
filters do do specialised little tasks to have gotten sick of doing it,
and so I wrote "filta" to do the job.

The language of filta is currently very small. I'd go so far as to say
it's tiny. But I have found it very useful - which is more than I can
say for some of the other things I've done. Here are the only tokens
recognised in the language...


== = != < > && || if else ( ) { } f# $# n t s "string" split

Like awk, filta splits all input lines by white space (' ' and TAB).
This can be changed or even turned off. The only action available is to
print. The only other things you can do are comparisons and
line-splitting. In the above, # refers to a positive integer. f# is
equivalent to $# and refers to the #'th field on the current input
line. f0 (and $0) refer to the whole line, f$ (and $$) refer to the
last field.

A string enclosed in double quotes is printed - C character
representations ("\n", "\t" etc etc) may be used. n, t and s are
equivalent to "\n", "\t" and " " respectively. (n = newline, t = tab, s
= space).

if, else, (, ), {, }, &&, ||, ==, !=, <, and > are all used as in C. 
= is entirely equivalent to ==.

The word "split" should be followed by a string of characters that the
input line should be split up on. Thus split " \t" splits on white
space, split ":" splits on colons. split "" does nothing. In
particular, if the first command in a filta program is a split, then
the default splitting on white space is not done. So to turn off
splitting altogether one does split "" first off.

There is no need to separate commands with white space. Thus f1f2 means
print field one and field two, as does f1 f2 and $1$2 and $1 $2.

Here is a simple use of filta.

    cat file | filta 'f1 "\n"'

which prints the first white space separated field of each line and
then a newline. This could have also been done more simply as "filta
f1n".  Here is a more complicated example.

    cat file | filta 'if (f1 = f2) f3 else f4'

And you can probably work out what this does. Of course this could have
been written as filta 'if(f1=f2)f3elsef4' for those that don't like
spaces. Note the hard single quotes around the program to hide the
parentheses (or double quotes) from the shell.

    cat /etc/passwd | 
    filta 'split":" if (f1 = "tcjones") "Terry's home directory is " f6n'

etc. It is possible to leave out the "if" as well. Thus the above could
have started off filta 'split":" (f1="tcjones")' etc etc.

It is also possible to split a line more than once. For example
(assuming my encrypted password contains no commas!)

    cat /etc/passwd 
    | filta -s 'split":" if ($1="tcjones") {split"," "my office is " f2n}'

And so on.


So what does filta actually do? Your small program is read and parsed
and a simple (usually 50 odd lines) C program is produced. This is then
executed by filta and as a result gets the standard input that filta
was supplied with. By necessity the resulting a.out file is left in the
current directory (if possible) and can (and SHOULD) be re-used. By
default the source is removed before the a.out file is executed. You
can arrange for the source to be kept with the -s flag.  So

    cat file | filta -s f1 s f2n

is a filter that prints the first field, a space, the second field and
a newline BUT in addition you get to keep the C source. If you want to
run it again you just say

    cat file | a.out

The source is placed in Filta.c in the current directory (if
possible).  The filter program that is built can handle input lines of
length up to 4K with up to 20 fields. But that's easily changed, seeing
as -s gives you the source.

If you just type

    filta -s

filta will wait for you to enter a program. This will be translated
into C, the resulting code will be compiled but NOT executed. Saying

    filta -s f1n

is not the same. This will write the C program, compile it and execute
it (and will therefore sit there waiting for you to type input at it).

If filta is unable to write the current directory it puts the source in
strangely named files in under /tmp and tells you where they may be found.

Also valid is 

    filta -f <filename>

which reads the program from the file <filename>.



Anyway I'm not going to go any more. There are more details it is handy
to know, but if you want them send me mail or read the code. filta is
not meant to be an awk replacement, it just makes it easier to do some
things with greater speed, and easier and MUCH faster to repeat (using
the a.out produced).  It is also very useful as a starting point for
the writing of your own special purpose filters. Have fun.
